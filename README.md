# Bank Churn Prediction Model

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e., leave the bank), using machine learning.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains features like:
- Credit Score
- Age
- Balance
- Estimated Salary
- Number of Products
- Tenure
- Exited (target label: 1 = churned, 0 = stayed)

## ðŸš€ Model
I used a Deep Learning model (Neural Network) to classify customers based on historical data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation
The model was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC-ROC curve
